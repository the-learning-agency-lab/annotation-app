{"idx":479,"question":"A student's daily study times (in minutes) over five days are 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60. If the student replaces their longest study time with 45 minutes, which of the following describes the changes to the mean, median, and range of the data?\n\nComment: I like the idea, but a student wouldn't \"replace\" their longest study time. If they studied for 60 minutes, then they studied for 60 minutes. Replacing a time doesn't make any sense, unless the context explains that they were telling someone else how long they studied, and the person recorded it incorrectly or something.
