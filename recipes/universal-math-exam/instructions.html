        <h1>Universal Math Exam Multiple-Choice Question Rubric</h1>
        <p>This rubric provides guidelines for creating high-quality multiple-choice math questions aligned with
            standardized
            test formats. Use these criteria to evaluate and improve question quality across different components.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="criteria-section">
        <h2>Evaluation Components</h2>
        <p>Each multiple-choice question is evaluated on three key components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Question Overall</strong> - Alignment with topic labels and appropriate difficulty level</li>
            <li><strong>Question Stem</strong> - Clarity, relevance and proper structuring of the central problem</li>
            <li><strong>Answer Choices</strong> - Quality and effectiveness of response options</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="criteria-section">
        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <p>Questions are scored on a scale from 0-3 for each component:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 (Excellent)</strong> - Meets all criteria at the highest level</li>
            <li><strong>2 (Satisfactory)</strong> - Meets most criteria with minor issues</li>
            <li><strong>1 (Needs Improvement)</strong> - Meets some criteria but has significant issues</li>
            <li><strong>0 (Inadequate)</strong> - Fails to meet most criteria</li>
