        <h1>Universal Math Exam Multiple-Choice Question Rubric</h1>
        <p>This rubric provides guidelines for creating high-quality multiple-choice math questions aligned with
            standardized
            test formats. Use these criteria to evaluate and improve question quality across different components.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="criteria-section">
        <h2>Evaluation Components</h2>
        <p>Each multiple-choice question is evaluated on three key components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Overall</strong> - Alignment with topic labels and appropriate difficulty level</li>
            <li><strong>Question Stem: Topic</strong> - Relevance of the central problem to the stated domain, label, and task</li>
            <li><strong>Question Stem: Vocabulary</strong> - Clarity of language and proper structuring of the question</li>
            <li><strong>Answer Choices</strong> - Quality and effectiveness of response options</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="criteria-section">
        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <p>Questions are scored on a scale from 0-3 for each component:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 (Excellent)</strong> - Meets all criteria at the highest level</li>
            <li><strong>2 (Satisfactory)</strong> - Meets most criteria with minor issues</li>
            <li><strong>1 (Needs Improvement)</strong> - Meets some criteria but has significant issues</li>
            <li><strong>0 (Inadequate)</strong> - Fails to meet most criteria</li>

            <h3>Math Expression Formatting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Questions use <strong>LaTeX</strong> formatting for mathematical expressions.</li>
                <li>In-line math expressions should be surrounded by single dollar signs: <code>$expression$</code></li>
                <li>If you need an actual dollar sign to appear in text, escape it with a backslash: <code>\$</code></li>
                <li>Some questions may use <code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code> instead of dollar signs for math. These can (optionally) be replaced with <code>$</code> for consistency, which has the same effect.</li>
                <li>If extensive changes to mathematical expressions are needed, please consult these resources:
                    <ul><strong>LaTeX</strong> syntax for math operations are described in this <a href="https://gitmind.com/faq/formula-list.html">cheat sheet</a>.</ul>
                    <ul>Copy and paste your revised question stem and/or answer choices into this <a href="http://www.tlhiv.org/ltxpreview/">preview tool</a> to verify that they display correctly.</ul>
