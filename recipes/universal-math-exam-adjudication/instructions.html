        <h1>Universal Math Exam Multiple-Choice Adjudication</h1>
        <p>Multiple-Choice items have been revised by a team of annotators. Your task is to choose which version of the item is higher quality. Please refer to our rubric, reproduced below.</p>

    <div class="criteria-section">
        <h2>Evaluation Components</h2>
        <p>Each multiple-choice question is evaluated on three key components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Overall</strong> - Alignment with topic labels and appropriate difficulty level</li>
            <li><strong>Question Stem: Topic</strong> - Relevance of the central problem to the stated domain, label, and task</li>
            <li><strong>Question Stem: Vocabulary</strong> - Clarity of language and proper structuring of the question</li>
            <li><strong>Answer Choices</strong> - Quality and effectiveness of response options</li>
